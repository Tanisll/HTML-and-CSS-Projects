            <p style="margin-left: 500px; text-indent:  50px; margin-right: 500px;">So far, I've really enjoyed writing code in VS. It's predictions are far more intuitive than Notepad++. The program also auto ends your tags for you. If you hit enter after opening a tag, it will double drop the end tag and indent the space in between the opening and ending tags for you to keep writing in. This is super nice and makes it very easy to nest your other tags within eachother.</p>
