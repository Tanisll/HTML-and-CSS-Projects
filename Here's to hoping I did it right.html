<body> 
<p>Hello, world!
This next line is just for me to see how indented lines work
	I wanted to know if I can put the "</p>" icon wherever I wanted.</p>
After seeing how the close paragraph icon works, I see now that I cannot simply add that icon whever I wanted. </p>
It will cause my line of text to jump to the next line.</p>
I wonder how to just down two lines... Do I just make that symbol twice?</p>
</p>
Lets see if that worked.</p>
 </p> .</p>
I also found that it's easier if i just keep that close paragraph symbol on my clipboard</p>
I just discovered that the close paragraph symbol will not double return the paragraph for me as I had hoped.</p>
I have to add a period just to push it down.</p>
I tried a space and it didn't do anything.</p>
I also just discovered that I do not need to reopen the document each time I make a change.</p>
I can just hit the refresh button on the chrome browser after I hit save on Notepad++.</p>
