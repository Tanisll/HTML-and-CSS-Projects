HTML and CSS Projects

In this repository, I will be publishing all of my HTML and CSS projects done while attending The Tech Academy bootcamp.
It is my intent to make this repository public for all to see. 
This will be available as an example of my learning experience, as well as evidence of my abilities.

Projects
Space Station Site
Movie Theater Site
Dog Breeding Site
World of Fish Site
And various other assignments

Space Station Site
This page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains
a navbar, image containers, and a form.

Movie Theater Site
This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Boostrap 4. It
contains many Boostrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form,
cards, and dropdowns.

Dog Breeding Site
This page is an example of building many different HTML pages and linking them all together. This site was constructed, from scratch, using the HTML and CSS ideas from my assignments along the way. I actually own the domain name and plan on creating this website for my wife to breed her dogs in the future!

World of Fish Site
This was an earlier assignment that showed us how to position pictures, embed youtube videos, and make a form for people to fill out. This also taught me how to assign IDs to specific parts of the page and then be able to navigate to that section with a nav bar.

The other Miscellaneous Assignments
These are simple crude pages I did as assignments throughout the course and really don't have any importance at all, other than you get to see my learning process. 

All in all, this was a very informative course and I feel like I’ve learned SO MUCH in such a short amount of time. I’m really enjoying myself and I love to learn and create things. I’m very excited for the next few courses and to eventually get into my dream field of work!
